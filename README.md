# Yarn-Spinner-Demo
An example project with commented code that explains the process of using Yarn and Unity. Created in 2019 for @jafish's Games 1 Class.

All of the slides / documents are in the 00-SLIDES-REFEREENCE folder, and the empty demo is for students to follow along 

As part of the demo, students are also asked to create a custom font and a 2D particle effect. 

The dialogue is copied (with love!) from The Stanley Parable.
