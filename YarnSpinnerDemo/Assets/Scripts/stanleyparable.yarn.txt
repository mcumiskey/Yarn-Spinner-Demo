This is the story of a man named Stanley.

Stanley worked for a company in a big building where he was employee number 427. 

Employee Number 427's job was simple: he sat at his desk in room 427, and he pushed buttons on a keyboard. 

Orders came to him through a monitor on his desk, telling him what buttons to push, how long to push them, and in what order.

This is what Employee 427 did every day of every month and every year, and although others might have considered it soul-rending, Stanley relished every moment that the orders came in, as though he had been made exactly for this job.

And Stanley was happy.

And then one day, something very peculiar happened. 

Something that would forever change Stanley. 

Something he would never quite forget.

He had been at his desk for nearly an hour when he realized that not one single order had arrived on the monitor for him to follow. 

No-one had showed up to give him instructions, call a meeting, or even say "Hi". 

Never in all his years at the company had this happened - this complete isolation. 

Something was very clearly wrong. 

Shocked, frozen solid, Stanley found himself unable to move for the longest time. But as he came to his wits and regained his senses, he got up from his desk and stepped out of his office.

As he stepped out of his cubicle, Stanley was dumbfounded to find his day-to-day office, usually packed with his busy co-workers, was completely empty. 

No one was clacking at their keyboards, staring at screens, drinking their mugs of coffee, nothing.

Stanley slowly stepped through the office, gentle noises of his shoes against the murky-yellow carpeted floor. 

Not a whisper or word anywhere. He looked into the windows of the other cubicles, but no workers in sight. 

Even the tall, green pot plant outside Room 420 was beginning to die, and Employee 420 always watered it every morning. Quiet humming and beeps came from the clean, white tables. 

A quick glance proved even the computers were still on. The two large windows on the opposite wall were filled with blinding white light, and Stanley was never sure even when they were this bright before.

He took one last, desperate look around, but nothing...

Stanley was alone. What could it have meant? Stanley decided to go to the meeting room, perhaps he had simply missed an urgent memo.

-> >> Walk into the hallway

As Stanley walked into the hallway, he came to an empty room with a set of two open doors: One on his left, and one on his right. The way to the meeting room was the left door, so without hesitation, he entered that one.

Stanley stands in the door way, taking one last look at the grand work space in front of him, and closes his office door.

Stanley simply couldn't handle the pressure. What if he had to make a decision? What if a crucial outcome fell under his responsibility? 
He had never been trained for that! No, this couldn't go any way except badly. The thing to do now was to wait. 
Nothing will hurt me, Stanley thought, nothing will break me.
In here I can be happy forever. 
I will be happy.

Stanley waited. 
Hours passed. 
Then days. 
Had years gone by? 
He no longer had the ability to tell. 
But one thing he was sure of was that some day, the answers would come. Eventually, they would arrive. Very soon now, this will end. He will be spoken to. He will be told what to do. Now it's just a little bit closer. Here it comes...

This was not the correct way to the meeting room, and Stanley knew it perfectly well. 
This of course was the way to the employee lounge, so perhaps Stanley wanted to stop by it first, just to admire it.
-> >> Enter the Lounge 
Ah, yes, truly a room worth admiring. The room was coated in gentle deep-sea blue wallpaper. 
Several recliners and coffee tables littered the room and a cold drink machine sat in the corner humming quietly. 
What a room, what a room.

-> >> Admire the employee lounge
    Yeeesss, really, really worth it being in this room. 
    A room so utterly eye-catching, even though your co-workers had all vanished, you decide to spend your time gawking at some chairs and paintings. 
    Really worth it, Stanley.
    -> >> Continue Admiring 
        At this point, Stanley's obsession on this room was on the brink of being creepy, and reflected poorly on his overall personality. 
        This is probably why everyone left.

Stanley walked through the hallway into the meeting room.
Once again, he was greeted with an empty room, filled with a large table with several chairs up against it. 
Business charts riddled with statistics littered the walls.

Apart from Stanley, there was not a single person here either. 
Feeling a wave of disbelief, Stanley decided to go up to his boss's office, hoping he'd find an answer there. 
As he exited the meeting room, he entered another hallway. On his left was a door titled BROOM CLOSET.

Coming to two opposite staircases, Stanley walked upstairs to his boss's office.

Stanley stepped into the broom closet, cramped in a tiny cubical, surrounded by cardboard boxes and a wooden mop. 
There was nothing there. So, he turned around and got back on track.
-> >>Get back on track
   [[Staircase]]
-> >>Stay in the broom closet
    There was nothing here. 
    No choice to take, no path to follow; just an empty broom closet. 
    No reason to still be there.
          -> >>Get back on track
   	 [[Staircase]] 
          -> >>Continue to Stay in Broom Closet
	It was baffling that Stanley was still just sitting in the broom closet. 
	He wasn't even doing anything! 
	At least if there was something to interact with, he'd be justified in some way.
		-> >>Get back on track
   	      	[[Staircase]] 
		-> >> Continue to do nothing
	    Are you... Are you really still in the broom closet? 
	    Standing around doing nothing?
  	    ...Why?
	    Please offer me some explanation here, I'm genuinely confused.
	    -> >>Get back on track
   	 	[[Staircase]] 
	    -> >> I'm waiting for more dialogue
	         You do realise there's no choice or anything in here, right? 
	         If I had said "Stanley walked past the broom closet", at least you would've have a reason for exploring it to find out. 
	         But, it didn't even occur to me because literally this closet is of absolutely no significance to the story, whatsoever. 
	         I never would've thought to mention it.
		-> >> My choice is to stay in this broom closet
		Maybe to you, this is somehow its own branching path. 
		Maybe, when you go talk about this with your friends, you'll say "Oh, did you get the broom closet ending? 
		The broom closet ending was my favourite!" 
		I hope your friends find this concerning.
		       ->> >> I have no friends, I think I'll stay here
		       Stanley was fat and ugly and really, really stupid. 
		       He probably only got the job because of a family connection, that's how stupid he is. 
		       That or with drug money. 
		       Also, Stanley is addicted to drugs and hookers.
			->> >> This broom closet is my home
			Well, I've come to a very definite conclusion about what's going on right now: 
			You're dead. 
			You got to this broom closet, explored it a bit, and were just about to leave because there's nothing here, when a physical melody of some sort, shut down your central nervous system, and you collapsed on the keyboard. 
			Well, in a situation like this, the responsible thing is to alert someone nearby, so as to ensure that your body is taken care of before it begins to decompose.

			Hello? 
			Anyone who happens to be reading this, the person at this computer is dead. 
			He or she has fallen prey to any number of your countless human physiological vulnerabilities! It's indicative of the long-term sustainability of your species! 
			Please remove their corpse from the area, and instruct another human to take their place at the computer; making sure they understand basic text-based game mechanics, and filling them in on the history of narrative tropes in gaming so that the irony and insightful commentary of this game is not lost on them!

Stepping into his manager's unnecessarily large office, Stanley was once again stunned to find not an indication of any human life. Shocked, unraveled, Stanley wondered in disbelief who orchestrated this, what dark secrets were being held from him!

What he could not have known was that the keypad behind the boss's desk guarded the terrible truth that his boss had been keeping from him, and so the boss had assigned it an extra secret pin number:

2 - 8 - 4 - 5.

-> Enter 2-8-4-5 into the keypad

Yet amazingly, buy pushing random buttons into the keypad, Stanley discovered the correct code by sheer luck. Bravo, Stanley. 
The panel on the wall opened up and Stanley walked into the opened passageway.
[[LazyMiles]]

-> Enter the passageway

After entering the darkened passageway, Stanley found an elevator with a large red button. 
He got into the elevator.
[[LazyMiles]]


-> Push the red button.
    With a jiggle and a metallic shake, the elevator sunk slowly into the ground.
    
    As it descended deeper and deeper into the building, Stanley realised he felt a bit peculiar. 
    It was a stirring of emotion in his chest, as though he felt more free to think for himself; to question the nature of his job. Why did he feel this now, when for years, it had never occurred to him? 
    This question would not go unanswered for long.
    
    The elevator came to a shuddering halt and the rusty door wrenched open. 
    Stanley walked straight ahead to the large door that read 'Mind Control Facility'. 
    There was also a long hallway on the left labeled crudely with a marker. 
    The sign read 'Escape', but Stanley took no notice.
[[LazyMiles]]


-> Don't push the button
    Boop

But Stanley just couldn't do it. 

He considered the possibility of facing his boss, admitting he had left his post during work hours.

He might be fired for that. 

And in such a competitive economy, why had he taken that risk? 

All because he had believed everyone had vanished? His boss would think he was crazy.

And then something occurred to Stanley.

"Maybe," He thought to himself. "Maybe, I am crazy. All of my co-workers blinking mysteriously out of existence in a single moment, for no reason at all?" None of it made any logical sense.

Stanley began to pace further into the room, pondering how all this could be possible.

-> >>Walk into the next room

As he pondered this, he began to make other strange observations. 
For example; why couldn't he see his feet when he looked down? 
Why did doors close automatically behind where ever he went? 
And for that matter, these rooms were starting to look pretty familiar. Were they simply repeating? "No," Stanley thought to himself. "This is all too strange, this can't be real..."

And at last, he came to the conclusion that had been on the tip of his tongue.

He just hadn't found the words for it.

"I'M DREAMING!" 
He yelled. 
"This is all a dream!".

Ah, what a relief Stanley felt to have finally found an answer; an explanation. 

His co-workers weren't actually gone, he wasn't going to lose his job, he wasn't crazy after all. 

And he thought to himself, "I'll suppose I'll wake up soon. I'll have to go back to my boring real life job pushing buttons, I may as well enjoy this while I'm still lucid.

-> >> Begin lucid dreaming

Stanley imagined himself flying, and began to gently float above the ground. 
Then he imagined himself soaring through space on a magical star field, and it too, appeared. 
It was so much fun!
And Stanley marveled that he still hadn't woken up. 
How was he remaining so lucid? 
And then perhaps the strangest question of them all entered Stanley's head, one he was amazed he hadn't asked himself sooner:

Why is there a page of text, dictating everything I'm doing and thinking? 
Now the text was describing itself being considered by Stanley, who found it particularly strange. 
"I'm dreaming about a text, describing me thinking about how it's describing my thoughts." 
He thought. 
And while he thought it all very odd, and wondered if this text appeared to all people in their dreams, the truth was, this was not a dream. 
How could it be? 
Was Stanley simply deceiving himself? 
Believing that if he's asleep, that he doesn't have to take responsibility for himself?

Stanley is as awake right now as he's ever been in his life. 
Now seeing the text printing these words was quite a shock to Stanley. After all, he knew for certain, without a doubt, that this was, in fact, a dream. 
Did the text not see him float and make the magical stars just a moment ago? 
How else would the text explain all that? 
This text was a part of himself too! Surely, surely, if he could...

He would prove it. He would prove that he was in control. 
That this was a dream. 
So he closed his eyes gently, and he invited himself to wake up.

-> >> Close your eyes

He felt the cool weight of the blanket on his skin.
The press of the mattress on his back. 
The fresh air of the world outside this one.

"Let me wake up." 
He thought to himself. 
"I'm through with this dream. I wish it to be over. Let me go back to my job. Let me continue pushing the buttons."
"Please, it's all I want." 

I. 
Am. 
Okay...

-> >> Open your eyes

Stanley opened his eyes, still in the exact same room he was in moments ago.

Nothing had changed. He began screaming.

Stanley collapsed on the ground, and everything went black.

-> >> Die

This is the story of a woman named Mariella

Mariella woke up on a day like any other. 
She arose, got dressed, gathered her belongings, and walked to her place of work. 
But on this particular day, her walk was interrupted by the body of a man who was wandering through town, talking and screaming to himself, and collapsed dead on the sidewalk. 
And although she would soon turn and call for an ambulance, for a few brief moments, she considered the strange man. 
He was obviously crazy, this much she knew. 
Everyone knows what crazy people look like. 
And in that moment, she thought to herself how lucky she was to be normal.

"I am sane." 
she thought. 
"I am in control of my mind. I know what is real, and what isn't."
It was comforting to think this, and in a certain way, seeing this man made her feel better. 
But then she remembered the meeting she had scheduled for that day; the very important people, who's impressions of her would affect her career, and by extension: the rest of her life. 
She had no time for this, so it was only a moment she stood there, staring down at the body.

And then she turned and ran.
