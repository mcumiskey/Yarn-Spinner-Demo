    nodeBody: "This is the story of a man named Stanley.\n\nStanley worked for a company
      in a big building where he was employee number 427. \n\nEmployee Number 427's
      job was simple: he sat at his desk in room 427, and he pushed buttons on a keyboard.
      \n\nOrders came to him through a monitor on his desk, telling him what buttons
      to push, how long to push them, and in what order.\n\nThis is what Employee
      427 did every day of every month and every year, and although others might have
      considered it soul-rending, Stanley relished every moment that the orders came
      in, as though he had been made exactly for this job.\n\nAnd Stanley was happy.\n\nAnd
      then one day, something very peculiar happened. \n\nSomething that would forever
      change Stanley. \n\nSomething he would never quite forget.\n\nHe had been at
      his desk for nearly an hour when he realized that not one single order had arrived
      on the monitor for him to follow. \n\nNo-one had showed up to give him instructions,
      call a meeting, or even say \"Hi\". \n\nNever in all his years at the company
      had this happened - this complete isolation. \n\nSomething was very clearly
      wrong. \n\nShocked, frozen solid, Stanley found himself unable to move for the
      longest time. But as he came to his wits and regained his senses, he got up
      from his desk and stepped out of his office.\n\n[[>> Step out of your office|StepOut]]\n[[>>

      day-to-day office, usually packed with his busy co-workers, was completely empty.
      \n\nNo one was clacking at their keyboards, staring at screens, drinking their
      mugs of coffee, nothing.\n\nStanley slowly stepped through the office, gentle
      noises of his shoes against the murky-yellow carpeted floor. \n\nNot a whisper
      or word anywhere. He looked into the windows of the other cubicles, but no workers
      in sight. \n\nEven the tall, green pot plant outside Room 420 was beginning
      to die, and Employee 420 always watered it every morning. Quiet humming and
      beeps came from the clean, white tables. \n\nA quick glance proved even the
      computers were still on. The two large windows on the opposite wall were filled
      with blinding white light, and Stanley was never sure even when they were this
      bright before.\n\nHe took one last, desperate look around, but nothing...\n\nStanley
      was alone. What could it have meant? Stanley decided to go to the meeting room,
      perhaps he had simply missed an urgent memo.\n\n-> >> Walk into the hallway\n\nAs
      Stanley walked into the hallway, he came to an empty room with a set of two
      open doors: One on his left, and one on his right. The way to the meeting room
      was the left door, so without hesitation, he entered that one.\n\n[[>>Enter

      fell under his responsibility? \nHe had never been trained for that! No, this

      will hurt me, Stanley thought, nothing will break me.\nIn here I can be happy

      he was sure of was that some day, the answers would come. Eventually, they would
      arrive. Very soon now, this will end. He will be spoken to. He will be told

      once again stunned to find not an indication of any human life. Shocked, unraveled,
      Stanley wondered in disbelief who orchestrated this, what dark secrets were
      being held from him!\n\nWhat he could not have known was that the keypad behind
      the boss's desk guarded the terrible truth that his boss had been keeping from
      him, and so the boss had assigned it an extra secret pin number:\n\n2 - 8 -
      4 - 5.\n\n-> Enter 2-8-4-5 into the keypad\n\nYet amazingly, buy pushing random
      buttons into the keypad, Stanley discovered the correct code by sheer luck.
      Bravo, Stanley. \nThe panel on the wall opened up and Stanley walked into the
      opened passageway.\n[[LazyMiles]]\n\n-> Enter the passageway\n\nAfter entering
      the darkened passageway, Stanley found an elevator with a large red button.
      \nHe got into the elevator.\n[[LazyMiles]]\n\n\n-> Push the red button.\n    With
      a jiggle and a metallic shake, the elevator sunk slowly into the ground.\n    \n
      \   As it descended deeper and deeper into the building, Stanley realised he
      felt a bit peculiar. \n    It was a stirring of emotion in his chest, as though
      he felt more free to think for himself; to question the nature of his job. Why
      did he feel this now, when for years, it had never occurred to him? \n    This
      question would not go unanswered for long.\n    \n    The elevator came to a
      shuddering halt and the rusty door wrenched open. \n    Stanley walked straight
      ahead to the large door that read 'Mind Control Facility'. \n    There was also
      a long hallway on the left labeled crudely with a marker. \n    The sign read

      of facing his boss, admitting he had left his post during work hours.\n\nHe
      might be fired for that. \n\nAnd in such a competitive economy, why had he taken
      that risk? \n\nAll because he had believed everyone had vanished? His boss would
      think he was crazy.\n\nAnd then something occurred to Stanley.\n\n\"Maybe,\"
      He thought to himself. \"Maybe, I am crazy. All of my co-workers blinking mysteriously
      out of existence in a single moment, for no reason at all?\" None of it made
      any logical sense.\n\nStanley began to pace further into the room, pondering
      how all this could be possible.\n\n-> >>Walk into the next room\n\nAs he pondered
      this, he began to make other strange observations. \nFor example; why couldn't
      he see his feet when he looked down? \nWhy did doors close automatically behind
      where ever he went? \nAnd for that matter, these rooms were starting to look
      pretty familiar. Were they simply repeating? \"No,\" Stanley thought to himself.
      \"This is all too strange, this can't be real...\"\n\nAnd at last, he came to
      the conclusion that had been on the tip of his tongue.\n\nHe just hadn't found
      the words for it.\n\n\"I'M DREAMING!\" \nHe yelled. \n\"This is all a dream!\".\n\nAh,
      what a relief Stanley felt to have finally found an answer; an explanation.
      \n\nHis co-workers weren't actually gone, he wasn't going to lose his job, he
      wasn't crazy after all. \n\nAnd he thought to himself, \"I'll suppose I'll wake
      up soon. I'll have to go back to my boring real life job pushing buttons, I
      may as well enjoy this while I'm still lucid.\n\n-> >> Begin lucid dreaming\n\nStanley
      imagined himself flying, and began to gently float above the ground. \nThen
      he imagined himself soaring through space on a magical star field, and it too,
      appeared. \nIt was so much fun!\nAnd Stanley marveled that he still hadn't woken
      up. \nHow was he remaining so lucid? \nAnd then perhaps the strangest question
      of them all entered Stanley's head, one he was amazed he hadn't asked himself
      sooner:\n\nWhy is there a page of text, dictating everything I'm doing and thinking?
      \nNow the text was describing itself being considered by Stanley, who found
      it particularly strange. \n\"I'm dreaming about a text, describing me thinking
      about how it's describing my thoughts.\" \nHe thought. \nAnd while he thought
      it all very odd, and wondered if this text appeared to all people in their dreams,
      the truth was, this was not a dream. \nHow could it be? \nWas Stanley simply
      deceiving himself? \nBelieving that if he's asleep, that he doesn't have to
      take responsibility for himself?\n\nStanley is as awake right now as he's ever
      been in his life. \nNow seeing the text printing these words was quite a shock
      to Stanley. After all, he knew for certain, without a doubt, that this was,
      in fact, a dream. \nDid the text not see him float and make the magical stars
      just a moment ago? \nHow else would the text explain all that? \nThis text was
      a part of himself too! Surely, surely, if he could...\n\nHe would prove it.
      He would prove that he was in control. \nThat this was a dream. \nSo he closed
      his eyes gently, and he invited himself to wake up.\n\n-> >> Close your eyes\n\nHe
      felt the cool weight of the blanket on his skin.\nThe press of the mattress
      on his back. \nThe fresh air of the world outside this one.\n\n\"Let me wake
      up.\" \nHe thought to himself. \n\"I'm through with this dream. I wish it to
      be over. Let me go back to my job. Let me continue pushing the buttons.\"\n\"Please,
      it's all I want.\" \n\nI. \nAm. \nOkay...\n\n-> >> Open your eyes\n\nStanley
      opened his eyes, still in the exact same room he was in moments ago.\n\nNothing
      had changed. He began screaming.\n\nStanley collapsed on the ground, and everything
      went black.\n\n-> >> Die\n\nThis is the story of a woman named Mariella\n\nMariella
      woke up on a day like any other. \nShe arose, got dressed, gathered her belongings,
      and walked to her place of work. \nBut on this particular day, her walk was
      interrupted by the body of a man who was wandering through town, talking and
      screaming to himself, and collapsed dead on the sidewalk. \nAnd although she
      would soon turn and call for an ambulance, for a few brief moments, she considered
      the strange man. \nHe was obviously crazy, this much she knew. \nEveryone knows
      what crazy people look like. \nAnd in that moment, she thought to herself how
      lucky she was to be normal.\n\n\"I am sane.\" \nshe thought. \n\"I am in control
      of my mind. I know what is real, and what isn't.\"\nIt was comforting to think
      this, and in a certain way, seeing this man made her feel better. \nBut then
      she remembered the meeting she had scheduled for that day; the very important
      people, who's impressions of her would affect her career, and by extension:
      the rest of her life. \nShe had no time for this, so it was only a moment she
      stood there, staring down at the body.\n\nAnd then she turned and ran.\n\n[[TheEnd]]\n"
